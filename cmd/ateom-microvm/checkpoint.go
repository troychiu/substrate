// CheckpointWorkload suspends the actor and writes a portable snapshot.
//
// Contract with atelet: after we return, atelet uploads the checkpoint dir to object
// storage, then tears down bundles and resets the actor dir.
//
// What the snapshot holds depends on the requested scope:
//
//   - FULL: the whole guest. ateom drives the CH REST api-socket: pause -> snapshot
//     file://<CheckpointStateDir> (config.json + state.json + sparse memory-ranges)
//     -> tear the VMM down. Each container's rootfs is overlay(virtio-fs RO lower +
//     guest-tmpfs upper), so the writable upper lives in guest RAM and is captured by
//     the memory snapshot — process memory and rootfs writes both persist across
//     suspend/resume. The RO lower is reconstructed from the OCI image at restore, so
//     nothing rootfs-related ships. Durable-dir volumes are host-backed rather than in
//     guest RAM, so they ship alongside as a tar.
//   - DATA: the durable-dir volumes only, as that same tar. The guest is discarded, so
//     the actor cold-starts on restore with its volumes re-materialized.
//
// Either way the guest is paused first, which is what makes the tar coherent: the
// durable share is served write-through, so every completed guest write is already on
// the host and no further ones can arrive.
