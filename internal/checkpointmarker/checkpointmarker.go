// Package checkpointmarker reads and writes the per-actor checkpoint
// completion marker both ateom runtimes leave beside a finished checkpoint.
//
// A checkpoint is destructive: it takes the sandbox down. That makes it the
// one workload operation whose response cannot simply be re-derived by trying
// again — a caller that loses the response (an atelet restart, a deadline
// exceeded mid-call) has no way to tell "never started" from "finished, and
// the answer went missing". Replaying it drove the sandbox runtime against
// state the first attempt had already destroyed.
//
// The marker is what makes the second attempt answerable: ateom writes it once
// the snapshot files are all on disk, recording exactly the file list it is
// about to report, and consults it before touching the runtime. Writes are
// atomic, so a marker that exists is always complete.

// Read returns the marker recorded for actorUID by a checkpoint of the given

// ordinary case on a first attempt and is not an error.
//
// The scope match is what makes the marker answer "did THIS checkpoint
// finish?" rather than "has this actor been checkpointed?". The two differ
// because the marker is keyed on the actor: it names a per-actor path, and it
// outlives the attempt that wrote it until resetActorDirs clears it. A DATA
// marker replayed against a FULL request would have atelet commit a manifest
// claiming a full snapshot whose file set is only the durable-dir tar, leaving
// nothing to resume the guest from.
//
// A mismatch reports "no completed checkpoint" and leaves the marker alone:
// the request falls through to the ordinary path, where the runtime finds no
// sandbox to checkpoint and says so as unrecoverable. That is the honest
// answer for a differently-scoped checkpoint of an actor whose sandbox an
// earlier one already destroyed.
//
// Leaving it alone is about what Read may do, not about how long the marker
// survives: a record Read cannot use is still not Read's to delete, unlike the
// damaged one below that nobody can use. The fall-through usually removes it
// moments later anyway — both runtimes clear the checkpoint dir before taking
// a checkpoint — so this is not a promise that a mismatched marker outlives
// the call.
